str data type-I get what a string is, but I'm not 100% on using str(). Is it that it converts whatever data is entered into the parenthese to a 'string'? One of the examples in my book is: 
                qty=float(coffee_file.readline())--reading from one file
                more code more code
                tem_file.write(str(qty) + '\n')--writing to another file

so if qty=20.0, after str conversion into the new txt file it would be '20.0 \n'?
